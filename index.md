# Hello, we make services!

[wemake.services](https://wemake-services.github.io) is a group of technology evangelists and simply those who love to write beautiful code. We are dedicated to deliver products of high quality basing on best practices, broad experience and a good portion of common sense. We focus on large, both public-sector and commercial projects with complicated infrastructure, and we care about what we do.

We love Python and Elixir. We use JavaScript.

## Repeatable Software Development Process

It is a home and the only source of truth for our [`Repeatable Software Development Process`](/meta/rsdp) (also knows as [`RSDP`](/meta/rsdp)).

Here we document every possible event and action in our company.
You can have a look at how we work.

## Project status

We try to update this wiki as frequently as we can. But that's a lot of work to do!
Consider this project and `RSDP` as early alpha. Please, feel free [to open an issue](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/issues) about anything that confuses you.
