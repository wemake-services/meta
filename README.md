# Hello, we make services!

[wemake.services](http://wemake.services) is a group of technology evangelists and simply those who love to write beautiful code. We are dedicated to deliver products of high quality basing on best practices, broad experience and a good portion of common sense. We focus on large, both public-sector and commercial projects with complicated infrastructure, and we care about what we do.

We love Python and Elixir. We use JavaScript.


## Repeatable Software Development Process

It is a home and the only source of truth for our [`Repeatable Software Development Process`](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/wiki/Repeatable-Software-Development-Process) (also knows as [`RSDP`](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/wiki/Repeatable-Software-Development-Process)).

Here we document every possible event and action in our company. 
You can have a look at how we work.


## Structure

- [`wiki`](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/wiki) contains every process we have as detailed as possible
- `.gitlab` folder contains templates for issues and merge requests
- [`processes/`](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/tree/master/processes) folder contains our business processes in the `BPMN` format


## Purpose

This is a source code for one of our websites, which states our internal process to our customers and employees.

We try to make them 100% transparent for every member of a project.
Wait, what? Isn't it suppose to be super secret?

Well, no. We believe that by making everything transparent everyone wins:

1. Clients know what to expect from us
2. Employees know what their work would be like

But what if someone will just copy this process?
We will be actually happy to know that. That's a situation when everyone wins too:

1. Our colleagues will have a nice working business
2. We would exchange our experience in an open manner
3. Clients will receive a software of high quality


## Contributing

This is our internal tool, pull requests are not welcomed.
But, we welcome any discussion, if you do have any questions or suggestions make sure to share it with us by [opening an issue](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/issues/new).
