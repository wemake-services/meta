## How do we work

### We love good code

High code quality is something we've made our mission and speciality of. We do not tolerate letting things slide their way. It might seem relatively expensive, but you get a product that people enjoy and that is easy to maintain through time. No one can guarantee that there will be no unforeseen issues, but we believe the meticulous handling based on the best industry practices results in much less of that and you pay less in the long run.

### We are business-oriented

We do not work on made-up issues or things we just find convenient to work with against your real needs and interest. We develop what helps you move towards your particular business goals.

Basing on best practices.

### We care about the process

The majority of projects worldwide are executed according to a well-known step-by-step scheme which is sometimes referred as a waterfall model. The progress flows, like a waterfall, strictly through the planned scope until, with some amount of luck, it's done.

This introduces a list of pitfalls, which we prefer not to ignore, so let's consider more details.

The very first step of a project waterfall is scrupulous conception and design, which are then fixed in strict Terms of Reference. It gives the confidence in what you get at the end and in what extent. This is exactly what client loves it for.

But when it comes to reality, it usually goes not as perfect as planned. Actually, even worse than that: [CHAOS report](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf) claims that the average success rate is only 16.2% for software projects, meaning those that were completed on-time and on-budget. And speaking of the challenged ones, 52.7% costed 189% of their original estimate.

Apart from this numbers, a client gets only and solely what is put on paper. So it means that project plan does not imply any of the following:

1. Additional requests from the client;
2. Unforeseen issues being handled;
3. Sudden bright ideas;
4. Even sane requirements of reasonability.

To recup: this casual approach does not motivate a contractor to deliver a tiny bit more to a project than fixed in an agreement. It also works the way that a contractor will always try to get as much money as they can in order to, among other things, compensate high risks that are essential part of this methodology. 

When you have a casual project triangle restrictions, it means you never end up with full and clear understanding why this have costed that much, and how close you are to exceeding the budget or time.

This forms the majority of frictions between a client and a provider during a project. Apparently you might have already been exposed to them.

#### Hello, wemake a service

In order to overcome the disadvantages of conventional waterfall model, we introduce our own management approach. Following our naming pattern, which you might have already noticed, we call it "wemake a service". It leaves only two options for project limitation:

- project scope,
- or fixed due time and budget.

Although it might be something that does not look perfectly sensible from the first glance, practically it means that all parties care about the primary goal first and prioritize major things against less important ones to deliver a product that addresses the core issue.

The rule of thumb is that you cannot have both limitation options from above been set the same time. 

#### How it works

1. We design and document the first module of delivery basing on your priorities.
2. The module is broken down to small pieces. Each one has a declared price which comprises of two parts: what we pay to a developer, and our fee.
3. We deliver the pieces one by one. Each delivery has clear documentation. And you always have an access to our task management tool to check what is happening.
4. At the end of, e.g., two weeks—the exact period depends on a project—we collect all the closed tasks and form a clear invoice based on them. 
5. As we have adopted a strict quality assurance approach, you end up with a well-documented and working piece of your product. Any other software development team will not need any time to put the code into further work—code speaks for itself.

So you basically have transparency during the whole process and can tweak even on the lowest level. You do not lose control over your budget; you don't pay for anything but the delivered work, and since there is no long-term commitment, you can safely quit at any time.

Widely popularized FFF model, developed and described by Basecamp team in their "Getting Real" (2006) bestseller book, tricks you with an expectation of a full product being delivered in a fixed time; in our case, you know exactly what is going to be flexed, so you are not going to have hard time thinking about what to pare down. You just watch your product being delivered, having each piece added in an a self-containing, MVP way.

#### Audit and maintenance

Audit and, e.g., corporate training are, of course, special cases when we need to have the total scope to be clearly defined, so they are managed in a different way.

As far as the scope is fixed, using our rule of thumb we need to have its due time to be flexible.

We provide audit services only on place: we do not create reports that are separate from your code. We audit your repo directly, making changes and adding documentation and comments to your code. So we need to have a way to influence the processes, otherwise this audit is doomed to be practically useless for you.

On the other hand, if you want us to maintain some of your projects, it is necessary that we go with audit first—for the same exact reason of sanity.
