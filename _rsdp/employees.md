Our internal process principles are:
- **We pay per task (please read below).**
- The task rate is not a subject of argument in situ.
- **We work only remotely.**
- You are welcome to combine a full-time job with your job here.
- We exercise sound judgment, so you are welcome to introduce it whenever you feel it needs to be introduced.
- All that is interesting about the project, or might be used more then one time, must be fixed in documentation.
- Also, it needs to be mentioned that we do not spend our clients' budgets on educating junior developers.

### Not an employee yet?

Work with us! Learn how you can [get a job](/meta/rsdp/job-application).

### Task-based payment approach

We have adopted a not very common but still effective in its way compensation practice based on tasks [closed](/meta/rsdp/closing-issues) by a person. When hiring, we agree on your hourly rate, and, when assigning a task to you, we set a price for it based on delivery time estimation and your fixed rate.

So each task has an expressly declared price and every three days your [successfully completed](/meta/rsdp/definition-of-done) tasks are collected and paid for in bulk.

Basically, you have no limitation on how much you can earn,
although it works both ways: if you show low performance,
you get paid less than you could have been.

Please, also take a note that you will receive only
half of the money paid by the client.
So, if your rate to the client is, for example,
$100 - then you will receive $50.

See how our [billing](/meta/rsdp/billing) works.

### How my initial hourly rate is calculated

The first and most important thing we actually look at when calculating your rate is your open source projects contribution and your online presence that could introduce you better than just a self-description: your Stack Overflow activity, meetup talks, tech-related publications and so on.

We are all great fans of open source projects and educational activities within our spare time, and we presume that people we'd love to work with are kind of the same. Basically, the point is—if you love to code, you probably must have contributed somewhere or left an imprint of your devotion in any other way. And if you don't, we would not like to add more pain to your life.

On the other side, we do not care of:
- How much you were paid for your last job;
- Year of work experience (but of course we do care about the experience itself);
- What is an average compensation level for a developer in the region where you are based;
- Where you are based;
- Age, gender, or nationality.

But we do care of:
- your open source contribution;
- your talks on conferences and meetups;
- your presence and activity on StackOverflow;
- your competency, and qualification with the [tools we use](/meta/rsdp/tech-stack).

### How can my hourly rate be changed

It is perfectly possible, and you are very welcome to increase your hourly rate.

The most important thing that helps us to estimate things like that is, basically, how much of other people's time you save. By being capable to close complicated tickets on your own, without requesting the help of others, you decrease our expenses and we can pay you more.

If you successfully tackle tasks without the help of other developers, after some number of payment rounds you get promoted. We are now hammering out metrics and a clear algorithm for that, which we show you once ready.

Each time you get promoted, the absolute value of promotion also grows.

### What does the process look like?

<!--- TODO(@sobolevn): embed draw.io process -->

Summing up the whole thing. First, we agree on your rate. You then receive one task at a time and get the next once you have finished. If you find essentials gaps in the problem description, you update the status to 'Request more data', and you get assigned to another task.

You are welcome to leave clear to-dos for yourself and the one who will provide the missing pieces to let you deliver on that task later.

### If you got stuck

If you find yourself stuck while delivering the task, but you are dedicated to delivering by yourself, you might first want to try to find the answer by following the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) pattern or check if your embarrassment is caused by the fact that task or project environment, such as documentation provided, does not contain some information that is essential for this particular problem, and simply turn the ticket back to us with a request of such information.

If you were able to successfully tackle your problem, please fix the corresponding results in the documentation, or amend the project knowledge in some other suitable way, if relevant.
