title: "Roles and responsibilities for the project"
---

Each project [has a team](/meta/rsdp/team-and-scaling).
Each team has several required roles:

| Role      | Description | Responsibilities |
|-----------|:-----------:|:----------------:|
|   Client  |Single user, who represents a client|Monitoring progress, providing feedback, accepting results, providing business explanations|
| Architect |Single user, who represents the project lead|Is responsible for the project success, including: technical decisions, quality, documentation, and functionality|
| Developer |Users who deliver code|Solving given tasks, asking questions, delivering results|

You can always found out who's who by looking at the project's `README`. It will always have the `Client` and `Architect` defined.
So, all other users are `Developer`s. This table looks something like this:

| Role      | Name (GitLab username) |
|-----------|:-----------:|
| Client    |Ivanov Ivan (@ivanov_ivan)|
| Architect |Sobolev Nikita (@sobolevn)|
| Developer |Olga Petrova (@awesomeola)|


## What about managers?

We also have a project manager on board. But responsibilities of the project
manager in our team is not common.
We believe that good project manager **does not work at all** since some point in time.
Good project manager creates processes which do not require any interruptions.
So, we try to automate as many regular processes as possible.

Here's the full list of the responsibilities that each project manager has:

- Billing: making sure that payments from the client are received, sending micro-payments to the team members
- Working with client: providing statistics, answering questions, planning new features
- Working with the architect: making sure that architect does not have any problems or questions
- Working with business processes: finding bottlenecks, improving docs, generating new ideas
- Fixing any problems that emerge unexpectedly


## Client has responsibilities too

Every person in the team has responsibilities. Person coming from the client
has them too.

Main responsibilities of the client are:

1. Validate incoming invoices and pay them in time
2. Answer questions that are asked during the development
3. Pay other people to audit our code
4. Review features that needs to be reviewed and provide feedback
5. Notify us about changes in the [requirements](/meta/rsdp/requirements-analysis/)
